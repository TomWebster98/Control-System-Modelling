# High-Performance Motorsport Powertrain (Control) Modelling

Welcome to my High-Performance Motorsport Powertrain Modelling repository! This project aims to develop representations and models for high-performance motorsport powertrains, focusing on Formula 1 and British Touring Car (BTCC) hybrid engine modelling. The project utilises Python, Capella, MATLAB, and Simulink for modelling and simulation.

## Features

- Hybrid engine modelling for Formula 1 and British Touring Car Championship vehicles.
- Python-based implementation for engine mode control based on driver (user) input.
- Capella model diagrams to represent system functionality and data flow.
- MATLAB & Simulink models to simulate the control system response for engine mode inputs.
- Hybrid engine modelling for Formula 1 (F1) and British Touring Car Championship (BTCC)
